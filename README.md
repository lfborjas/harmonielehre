# Harmonielehre

Using minikanren (core.logic) to understand chords/harmony. Also, a chance to
practice more Clojure! Inspired by [SMUG](https://github.com/owickstrom/smug)
and [this post about generating sight reading
exercises](https://wickstrom.tech/generative-music/2016/08/07/generating-sight-reading-exercises-using-constraint-logic-programming-in-clojure-part-1.html)

## Next Steps

* Add support for notation?
* Add some UI for recording
